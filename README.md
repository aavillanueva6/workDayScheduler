# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose and Functionality

This application uses jQuery, momentjs, and bootstrap to display a responsive work calendar. The user is able to input text to the schedule, and save the text. The user input is then saved to local storage on their machine so that it is able to be retrieved at a later time.

## Key Learnings

- Use of third party APIs (jQuery, momentjs, bootstrap) to develop an application

## Deployed Site

The deployed site is hosted on github pages at the following link:

## Screenshots

## Known Bugs

- There is a wrapping issue at low screen sizes. likely due to the way that the grid is currently configured.

## Potential Future Improvements

- the get from local storage is hard coded in a likely very inefficient way. Would like to implement functionality to automate that pull more.
